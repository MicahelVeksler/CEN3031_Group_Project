these are the packages you need to install (use latest version for all):
- bcrypt
- pydantic
- fastapi
- databases
- sqlalchemy
- uvicorn
- passlib
- aiosqlite
- sqlite (Your python probably already has this)


to run the app locally, go into the terminal (make sure you are in the project root directory) and use this command:
uvicorn main:app --reload
then click the url it gives you. Add /docs at the end in your browser to use FastAPI's gui
